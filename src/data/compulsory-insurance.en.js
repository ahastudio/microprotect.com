it targets 450,000 Koreans in Germany, providing

and reminding them of “MicroProtect” as a channel for insurance.

In particular, it was confirmed that German is very difficult,
so more than half of Koreans live in Germany
and have difficulty communicating when going to a hospital.
By providing compulsory health insurance,
medical benefits are provided free of charge (at no extra cost)
to Koreans who cannot go to the hospital due to language problems.
